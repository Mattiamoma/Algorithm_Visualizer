# Algorithm Visualizer
 *A better way to understand sorting algorithms* 


## General info
This project is a simple algorithm visualizer with 8 different sorting algorithms to help you understand them better. 


The visualization of the different implementations is **not performance based**, every speed of sorting is chosen to create a better understanding of how they work. 

However you can still notice the speed differences between one algorithm and another
